Appendix: Empire Denied – Counterarguments and Their Collapse
Introduction
This appendix undertakes a critical examination of prevalent arguments employed to deny or obscure the imperial character of United States foreign policy. Common defenses often portray US global engagement as fundamentally benign, driven by liberal internationalist ideals, pragmatic realism, well-intentioned humanitarianism, or as comparatively restrained when measured against other global powers. This analysis seeks to dismantle these justifications by moving beyond surface narratives to expose the structural logic, historical foundations, and contemporary manifestations of US global power.
Each section addresses a specific line of defense against the charge of empire. It first outlines the typical claim made by proponents of that view and subsequently presents detailed counterpoints. These counterarguments are substantiated by evidence drawn from academic research, policy analysis, and critical scholarship, focusing on the interconnectedness of military, economic, and ideological power structures. A recurring theme is the often-understated role of racialized assumptions and settler-colonial legacies in shaping US policy and its justifications.
The overarching argument presented here is that the denial of US empire relies upon selective historical accounts, decontextualized comparisons, and a fundamental failure to recognize the unique scale, scope, and structural underpinnings of American global influence. By unmasking these defenses, a clearer picture emerges: a global system significantly shaped and dominated by the United States, designed not primarily for mutual benefit or genuine liberation, but for the maintenance of hierarchical control and pervasive influence. This represents an empire, perhaps not chiefly of direct territorial administration in the classical sense, but one defined by far-reaching, structural power.
I. The Liberal Internationalist Defense
Their Claim: The United States operates not as an empire, but as a unique global power committed to fostering a liberal international order. Its actions, according to this view, are aimed at promoting democracy, ensuring stability, and facilitating development worldwide through the establishment and support of international institutions and norms. The US, in this narrative, acts as a force for good on the world stage.
Your Counter-Argument: This liberal internationalist narrative, while appealing, functions more effectively as ideological camouflage than as an accurate description of US foreign policy. It masks a consistent pattern of selective interventionism, the aggressive promotion of neoliberal economic models that often undermine national sovereignty, and the invocation of humanitarian justifications that frequently precede disastrous geopolitical outcomes. The very tools championed by liberal internationalism—such as democracy promotion initiatives and the doctrine of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P)—are often deployed in ways that reinforce, rather than challenge, US global dominance.
A. Selective Application of Democracy Promotion
A central tenet of the liberal internationalist defense is the claim that the US actively promotes democracy globally. However, the empirical record reveals a stark inconsistency between this stated commitment and actual policy implementation. The United States frequently prioritizes perceived strategic and economic interests over democratic principles, maintaining strong alliances with and providing substantial support to authoritarian regimes when deemed geopolitically convenient.
US foreign policy, particularly in strategically vital regions like the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), exemplifies this tension. Official policy often speaks of balancing traditional national security interests with the long-term goal of democratic transformation. Yet, in practice, this translates into an approach characterized as "incremental," "gradualist," and often "collaborative" with existing power structures, explicitly avoiding support for "revolutionary shifts". This cautious evolutionary stance prioritizes stability—often defined as alignment with US interests—over potentially disruptive, albeit more genuine, democratic change.
The post-September 11, 2001 "Freedom Agenda," which explicitly linked the lack of political and economic freedom in the MENA region to the rise of terrorism, ostensibly elevated democracy promotion in US foreign policy. Influenced by analyses like the UN Arab Human Development Reports, the G.W. Bush administration framed democratization as both a counter-terrorism strategy and a broader approach to regional engagement. Despite this heightened rhetoric, historical patterns of prioritizing strategic interests persisted. The US has a documented history of neglecting human rights and democratization in the MENA region when these conflicted with other interests, such as oil access or Cold War alliances. A prominent example is the US involvement in the 1953 overthrow of Iran's democratically elected government.
The case of Egypt provides a contemporary illustration of this selectivity. The US has provided Egypt with nearly $90 billion in bilateral aid since 1946, with assistance increasing significantly after the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty. Successive administrations have justified this aid primarily as an investment in "regional stability" and maintaining the peace treaty, highlighting the long-standing security cooperation with the Egyptian military. While Congress has, for over a decade, conditioned a portion of the substantial Foreign Military Financing (FMF) provided to Egypt on democracy and human rights criteria, these conditions are frequently rendered ineffective. For FY2023, the Biden Administration waived the democracy and human rights certification requirement on $225 million in FMF, citing national security interests. An additional $95 million was released based on reported progress in releasing political prisoners and, significantly, Egypt's role as an intermediary between Hamas and Israel. This explicitly demonstrates how immediate geopolitical calculations override stated commitments to democratic conditionality. Furthermore, legislative changes in FY2024 appropriations mandated minimum aid levels for Egypt and moved the conditionality language out of the main bill text into an explanatory statement, arguably weakening its legal force and signaling a reduced emphasis on democratic benchmarks.
This pattern is not unique to Egypt. The enduring strategic alliance between the US and Saudi Arabia, despite the latter's autocratic governance and human rights record, is similarly justified based on energy security and regional counter-terrorism cooperation. The presence of US military bases in numerous authoritarian states across the Gulf and elsewhere further underscores this prioritization of strategic alignment over democratic values.
The consistent subordination of democracy promotion to strategic interests reveals its function within US foreign policy. Rather than a core, universally applied principle, it operates as a flexible tool, deployed when congruent with other objectives and readily sacrificed when not. It serves more effectively as a soft power tactic or a post-hoc justification for engagement than as a primary driver of policy. This instrumental application fundamentally undermines the liberal internationalist claim that the US acts primarily as a promoter of global democracy, exposing a clear hierarchy where strategic partnerships consistently outweigh the promotion of democratic governance in allied nations.
B. Promotion of Neoliberal Markets, Not Sovereignty
Beyond the selective promotion of political democracy, the liberal internationalist framework often conflates US influence with the benign spread of economic development and stability. However, a closer examination reveals that US "development" and "democracy" assistance programs are frequently intertwined with the promotion of neoliberal economic models. These models, emphasizing privatization, deregulation, free trade, and reduced state intervention , often serve to open markets for US capital and integrate recipient nations into a global economic system on terms favorable to established powers, potentially undermining their economic sovereignty and increasing dependency.
Neoliberalism is not merely an economic theory but a political project that seeks to reshape state-society relations, prioritizing entrepreneurial freedoms and market mechanisms. Its implementation through US foreign policy is often framed as essential for growth and modernization. However, critics argue that this project functions as an assertion of class power, favoring global and local capitalist interests and utilizing the state primarily as an apparatus to facilitate capital accumulation. Within this framework, state sovereignty, particularly over crucial economic decisions regarding capital flows, trade policy, and resource allocation, becomes contingent upon the demands and fluctuations of the global market.
A key mechanism for promoting neoliberalism globally has been the use of conditionalities attached to foreign aid and loans provided by the US government (through agencies like USAID) and international financial institutions (IFIs) such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. These institutions, established under US leadership in the post-WWII era (Bretton Woods Agreement) , often require recipient countries to implement structural adjustment programs—entailing privatization, liberalization, and fiscal austerity—as a prerequisite for receiving financial assistance. While ostensibly aimed at promoting economic stability and growth, these conditionalities significantly restrict the policy space available to recipient governments, limiting their ability to pursue alternative development paths tailored to local needs and circumstances.
The impacts of these imposed neoliberal reforms are widely debated. Proponents emphasize efficiency gains and integration into the global economy. Critics, however, point to increased inequality, the erosion of workers' rights, the underfunding of essential public services like health and education, and the creation of economic vulnerabilities. Rather than fostering sustainable and autonomous development, these policies can deepen dependency on foreign capital, aid, and volatile global markets. For many nations in the Global South, facing economic crises or seeking development finance, the lack of viable alternatives often means a de facto loss of economic sovereignty, as accepting IFI conditions becomes unavoidable. This dynamic has been characterized by some scholars as a form of neo-colonialism, where economic leverage replaces direct political rule.
The US has explicitly linked its democracy promotion efforts with the advancement of free-market economics. In the MENA region, for instance, initiatives like the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and the proposed Middle East Free Trade Agreement (MEFTA) were pursued alongside funding for democracy programs. This deliberate intertwining suggests that market access and economic restructuring according to neoliberal principles are integral components, perhaps even primary objectives, of US engagement, rather than merely incidental outcomes of democracy support.
The consistent and systematic promotion of neoliberal policies through various instruments of US foreign policy points towards a structural imperative aimed at reshaping global economies. This project seeks to align national economies with US economic interests and ideology, facilitating the expansion of American capital and reinforcing a hierarchical global order. The "development" offered through this lens is often synonymous with integration into a US-centric capitalist system, frequently on unequal terms. This reality challenges the liberal internationalist narrative that US economic influence is inherently benevolent or conducive to strengthening the sovereignty of other nations. It suggests, instead, that economic policy serves as a key pillar of a modern imperial structure based on influence and systemic integration.
C. R2P and NED Function as Ideological Camouflage
The liberal internationalist defense often points to specific institutions and doctrines as evidence of the US commitment to universal values like human rights and democracy. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) and the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) doctrine are frequently cited examples. However, critical analysis suggests that these instruments, while presented as neutral and principled, are often employed selectively and strategically, functioning as ideological camouflage to legitimize interventions or shape political outcomes in ways that align with US interests.
The National Endowment for Democracy (NED), established in the 1980s, was conceived partly to overtly carry out activities that had previously been undertaken covertly by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Although structured as a private, non-profit corporation, it is primarily funded by annual appropriations from the US government and subject to Congressional oversight. This unique structure allows it to operate with a degree of separation from direct government policy while still serving as an instrument of US foreign policy. Critics, notably William Robinson, argue that NED does not promote genuine, participatory democracy but rather "polyarchy"—a limited, elite-managed form of democracy designed primarily to maintain stability, manage popular mobilization, and ensure that political outcomes remain within bounds acceptable to US interests and local elites. According to this critique, NED works by deeply infiltrating civil society in target countries, funding specific NGOs, political parties, and media outlets to channel dissent and control political transitions from within, rather than allowing for potentially disruptive mass movements. Evidence cited includes NED's documented funding activities in countries where the US opposed the government, such as Venezuela, and its alleged involvement in supporting "color revolutions" in Eastern Europe. While some academic studies suggest that democracy aid, in general, can have positive effects or at least does not hinder democratization , other analyses specifically question the effectiveness of NED grants in consolidating democracy, suggesting they may be more adept at weakening regimes perceived as adversaries. The activities funded by NED have frequently generated tensions with host governments, who perceive them as undermining their authority. The recent political controversy surrounding NED funding, including calls for its dissolution and temporary funding freezes, underscores its perceived role as a tool of established US foreign policy objectives, with its potential dismantling viewed as signaling a significant shift away from the strategy of promoting democratic ideals as a source of American global influence.
Similarly, the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) doctrine, adopted by the UN in 2005, is presented as a normative framework to prevent mass atrocities (genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity). It posits that states have the primary responsibility to protect their populations, but if a state is unwilling or unable to do so, the international community has a responsibility to intervene, potentially including military force under Pillar 3 as authorized by the UN Security Council. While lauded by proponents as a crucial development in human rights protection, R2P has faced significant criticism regarding its application. Critics argue that it is often invoked selectively, reflecting the political interests and geopolitical calculations of powerful states rather than a consistent commitment to humanitarian principles. Its application has been accused of exhibiting double standards, with interventions occurring in some situations (e.g., Libya) while inaction prevails in others, and with Western powers and their allies often appearing immune from scrutiny. Furthermore, R2P is criticized by some as a potential guise for neo-colonialism or imperialism, providing a legitimizing framework for powerful states to interfere in the affairs of weaker ones under the pretext of humanitarianism. The operational focus has often disproportionately centered on Pillar 3 (military intervention), sometimes overshadowing the crucial aspects of prevention (Pillar 1) and rebuilding (Pillar 2). The inherent vagueness of the criteria for intervention and the potential for misuse raise persistent concerns about setting dangerous precedents for future interventions driven by non-humanitarian motives.
The cases of NED and R2P illustrate how institutions and norms grounded in liberal values can be co-opted or instrumentalized. Both leverage the language of democracy, human rights, and civilian protection, which hold broad international legitimacy. However, their implementation often appears selective, aligning closely with US strategic interests—whether in shaping political landscapes through NED funding  or justifying military interventions via R2P. This selective application leads critics to argue that these are not primarily tools for consistent norm enforcement, but rather instruments used for geopolitical advantage, regime change, or managing dissent within acceptable parameters ("polyarchy"). Consequently, the very mechanisms presented as evidence of the US acting as a benevolent "force for good" can be interpreted as components of a more subtle, yet potent, form of imperial influence, cloaking power politics in the legitimizing discourse of universal values. This challenges not only the specific claims about these instruments but also the broader sincerity and effectiveness of the liberal internationalist project as practiced by the US.
D. Case Study: Libya's Collapse vs. U.S. “Humanitarian” Narrative
The 2011 NATO intervention in Libya, authorized by the UN Security Council under the banner of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P), serves as a stark and cautionary case study. Initially presented as a necessary humanitarian action to prevent an imminent massacre of civilians by Muammar Gaddafi's regime, the intervention and its aftermath starkly contradicted the optimistic narrative, ultimately leading to state collapse, protracted civil war, and regional destabilization. This outcome severely undermines the claim that US-led interventions are inherently a "force for good."
The UN Security Council Resolution 1973 marked the first instance where R2P was explicitly invoked to authorize armed international intervention to protect civilians. The operation was initially hailed in many Western capitals as a model application of the doctrine, demonstrating the international community's resolve to act against mass atrocities.
However, this narrative quickly faced challenges. Critiques emerged regarding the premise of the intervention itself. Some analysts argued that the threat of imminent, large-scale massacres by Gaddafi's forces was exaggerated, potentially fueled by Gaddafi's inflammatory rhetoric and rebel propaganda, rather than concrete evidence of indiscriminate attacks on civilians at that stage. Questions were raised about whether the "just cause" threshold for military intervention under R2P had truly been met.
More substantial criticism focused on the execution and evolution of the NATO mission. While Resolution 1973 authorized "all necessary measures... to protect civilians," excluding a foreign occupation force, critics contend that the operation rapidly morphed from civilian protection into an explicit campaign for regime change. Actions such as targeting retreating Libyan forces and providing air support that directly enabled rebel advances went beyond a strict interpretation of the mandate. Furthermore, the rejection of ceasefire proposals accepted by the Gaddafi regime, coupled with continued NATO support for the rebels who refused negotiation, suggested that the "right intention" principle of R2P—acting solely for humanitarian purposes—was compromised. The argument was also made that armed intervention was not pursued as a genuine "last resort," as diplomatic and non-military options were arguably sidelined prematurely. The intervention became emblematic of the critique that R2P's focus often defaults to military reaction (Pillar 3) at the expense of prevention and peaceful resolution.
The most damaging critique, however, relates to the long-term consequences. Following Gaddafi's overthrow and death, Libya descended into chaos. Instead of a stable democracy, the country fragmented, leading to years of civil war between rival governments and myriad militias vying for power and resources. The collapse of state institutions created a security vacuum, resulting in widespread violence, a humanitarian crisis, the proliferation of weapons across the region, and the rise of extremist groups. Some analyses even suggest that the intervention, intended to save lives, may have ultimately resulted in a significantly higher death toll than if the initial conflict had run its course without external military involvement. A crucial failure identified by observers was the lack of international commitment to post-conflict reconstruction and stabilization—the "responsibility to rebuild" inherent in the R2P framework. Insufficient resources, planning, and political will were dedicated to helping Libya transition, contributing directly to the power vacuum and ensuing anarchy.
The Libyan catastrophe dealt a severe blow to the credibility and legitimacy of R2P, particularly in the Global South. It reinforced fears that the doctrine could be selectively used by powerful Western states as a pretext for intervention and regime change, serving geopolitical interests rather than consistent humanitarian principles. The perceived failures in Libya also complicated international diplomacy regarding subsequent crises, notably the conflict in Syria, where divisions hardened by the Libyan experience hindered unified action.
The Libya case starkly illustrates the potential perils of humanitarian intervention when divorced from a comprehensive, long-term strategy and adequate commitment to post-conflict stability. The gap between the initial humanitarian justification and the devastating outcome reveals deep contradictions within the practical application of liberal internationalist principles, particularly when military force is employed. The emphasis on intervention ("react") without commensurate focus on prevention and, crucially, rebuilding, highlights a potential bias towards coercive measures and a disturbing lack of accountability for the foreseeable, and often catastrophic, long-term consequences. This undermines the narrative of US-led interventions as inherently benevolent and exposes the risks of actions undertaken without a sustained commitment to the aftermath.
E. Weaponizing the Quote: An Empire of Influence
A common refrain used to deflect accusations of American empire is the statement, often attributed to policymakers or analysts, that "The United States does not seek an empire of territory, but of influence." While intended as a defense, this statement inadvertently captures the essence of modern US imperialism. It concedes the fundamental goal – the pursuit and maintenance of global dominance ("influence") – while attempting to neutralize the critique by contrasting it with an outdated, narrow definition of empire focused solely on direct territorial annexation and administration.
This "empire of influence" is precisely the structure this analysis seeks to illuminate. It operates not primarily through colonial governors and occupying armies (though military presence is crucial), but through a complex web of less visible, yet deeply embedded, mechanisms of control and shaping. These include:
 * Economic Leverage: Achieved through the promotion of neoliberal economic policies via aid conditionalities, trade agreements, and the structural power embedded within US-dominated international financial institutions like the IMF and World Bank. The global primacy of the US dollar further anchors this economic influence.
 * Political Shaping: Exercised through "democracy promotion" initiatives and institutions like the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which aim to cultivate pro-US elites, manage civil society, and ensure political developments align with American interests, often under the guise of fostering "polyarchy" rather than substantive democracy.
 * Military Coercion and Presence: Underpinned by an unparalleled global network of military bases, strategic alliances, and technological superiority, allowing for rapid intervention, power projection, and the shaping of security environments worldwide.
 * Ideological Hegemony: Maintained through the global appeal of American culture, technology, and educational institutions, coupled with the active promotion of specific political and economic ideologies (liberal democracy, free markets) and the framing of interventions through legitimizing norms like the Responsibility to Protect (R2P).
Therefore, the quote, rather than refuting the existence of empire, accurately describes its contemporary form. It highlights a shift from direct rule to indirect, structural dominance. This empire of influence, built on interconnected economic, political, military, and ideological pillars, allows the United States to exert pervasive power across the globe, shaping outcomes and limiting the autonomy of other nations in ways that serve its perceived interests. Recognizing this distinction is crucial for moving beyond simplistic denials and engaging with the complex realities of US global power today.
II. The Realist Rebuttal
Their Claim: The actions of the United States on the global stage are not evidence of a unique imperial project but rather represent the standard behavior of any great power operating within an anarchic international system. According to realist theory, all states prioritize survival and pursue power and security out of rational self-interest. US foreign policy, in this view, is driven by pragmatic considerations of national interest and the distribution of power, not by a distinctive imperial ideology.
Your Counter-Argument: While acknowledging the undeniable role of power politics in international relations, the realist perspective provides an incomplete and ultimately inadequate explanation for the nature and scope of US global power. This view tends to overlook crucial factors that distinguish the US case. First, it neglects the specific historical formation of the United States as a settler-colonial state, a foundation that embedded particular logics of expansion and racial hierarchy into its structure. Second, it fails to grapple with the unprecedented scale and scope of America's global military and economic presence, which qualitatively differentiates it from historical great powers. Third, realism often minimizes or ignores the vital ideological and racial dimensions that are used to justify, legitimize, and structure US power, dimensions that are essential for understanding how this power operates both materially and symbolically.
A. Settler-Colonial Foundation and Structural Imperialism
A fundamental limitation of applying a generic realist lens to the United States is its failure to account for the nation's specific historical origins. The US did not emerge as just any state pursuing power within an existing system; it was founded and forged through a process of settler colonialism. This foundational experience embedded a distinct set of logics—concerning land, race, expansion, and elimination—into the very structure and ideology of the American state, which continues to resonate in its global posture.
From its inception, the United States was conceived and built as a settler state, predicated on the European colonization of North America, the systematic dispossession and elimination of Indigenous populations, the appropriation of their lands, and an economy reliant on enslaved African labor. This process was not a peaceful settlement but involved centuries of warfare against sovereign Native Nations to conquer the continent and establish settler dominance. As scholar Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz argues, the pervasive myth of the US as a "nation of immigrants" serves to erase this violent foundational history of settler colonialism. Settler colonialism, as theorized by Patrick Wolfe and others, is not merely a historical event confined to the past but an enduring structure aimed at replacing the native population with a new settler society.
This structure operates through specific, interconnected logics. It involves the transformation of Indigenous land tenure systems into concepts of private property and real estate commodity. It necessitates the racialization of both Indigenous peoples and other groups (like enslaved Africans) to justify their dispossession, exploitation, or elimination. Crucially, it entails a persistent drive for territorial expansion and the extension of settler sovereignty. The founders of the US were not simply colonists seeking independence; they were explicitly imperialist in their vision, planning the conquest of the continent westward to the Pacific, driven by aspirations for resources and access to Asian markets.
These foundational logics did not simply vanish with the closing of the frontier. The ideas of expansion, racial hierarchy, and the perceived mission to "civilize" or "uplift" supposedly inferior peoples became deeply ingrained in American political culture and institutions. These same logics can be seen projected onto the global stage, informing US interventions, foreign aid programs, and development ideologies throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. The concept of "development" itself, often presented as benevolent aid, can function as a modern iteration of the "civilizing mission," acting as a racializing technology that categorizes populations into hierarchical stages of progress and justifies external intervention. Even the process of integrating later waves of immigrants involved a "seasoning process" of Americanization, incorporating them into the dominant settler structure and its attendant ideologies.
Understanding this settler-colonial foundation provides crucial context that generic realism misses. US expansionism and its pursuit of global influence are not simply abstract calculations of power in an anarchic system. They are deeply informed by a specific historical trajectory and an embedded structural logic rooted in conquest, displacement, and racial hierarchy. The drive to shape global environments, transform other societies, and secure access to resources echoes the earlier continental imperial project. Realism's state-centric and often ahistorical approach fails to capture this specific content and origin of US power motivations, thereby offering only a partial explanation for the particular character and enduring nature of American global engagement. Recognizing the settler-colonial structure provides a more profound understanding of why US power operates in the ways that it does, including its persistent ideological justifications based on notions of uplift and improvement.
B. Unprecedented Scale and Scope of Global Presence
While realism posits that all great powers seek to enhance their security and influence, it often fails to adequately address the sheer magnitude of the United States' global military and economic infrastructure. The scale of the US presence is not merely quantitatively larger than that of its rivals or historical predecessors; it is qualitatively different, constituting a unique global architecture of power that challenges the notion of "standard" great power behavior.
The most visible manifestation of this is the US global military footprint. Estimates suggest the US maintains between 750 and 800 military base sites in approximately 80 foreign countries and territories. Even critiques challenging this specific number acknowledge a vast network, potentially confirming between 225 and 375 distinct facilities, depending on methodology. Whichever figure is used, it represents the overwhelming majority—estimated at 75% to 90%—of all foreign military bases worldwide.
This dwarfs the overseas presence of any other nation. Comparative data highlights the disparity:
Table 1: Comparative Estimated Foreign Military Base Sites (c. 2021)
| Country | Estimated Number of Foreign Base Sites | Primary Sources |
|---|---|---|
| United States | ~750-800 (Vine/OBRACC estimate) / ~225-375 (Critique range) |  |
| United Kingdom | ~145 |  |
| Russia | ~12-36 |  |
| China | ~8 |  |
Note: Figures are estimates and subject to definitional variations.
This vast network includes significant concentrations of forces in key strategic regions like Europe (Germany, Italy) and East Asia (Japan, South Korea), alongside installations scattered across the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania. This global basing structure provides the US with unparalleled logistical capabilities, intelligence-gathering platforms, and the capacity for rapid power projection virtually anywhere on earth.
This military dominance is interwoven with and reinforced by exceptional economic and ideological reach. The US dollar remains the world's primary reserve currency, granting the US significant financial advantages (the "exorbitant privilege"). The US played the leading role in establishing and continues to hold substantial influence within key international financial institutions (IMF, World Bank) that shape global economic policies. American corporations, technology, and markets exert immense global influence. Furthermore, US ideological power, promoting democracy and capitalism, is projected globally through cultural exports, educational exchange, and diplomatic initiatives. This unique integration of ideological, economic, military, and political (IEMP) power sources creates reinforcing feedback loops, amplifying US influence.
The sheer scale and multidimensional nature of this global presence transform quantitative superiority into a qualitative difference in structural power. It allows the United States to shape international agendas, define security threats, intervene militarily and economically, and influence political outcomes in ways fundamentally unavailable to other states. This capacity goes beyond the traditional realist conception of states balancing power within an anarchic system. The US, due to its unique scale and reach, operates within a system that is arguably more hierarchical than anarchic, with itself positioned at the apex. Realism's focus on the structure of anarchy risks overlooking the hierarchical structure imposed by decades of US dominance, a structure built and maintained by this unprecedented global presence. Therefore, characterizing US actions as merely "standard" great power behavior fails to capture the unique structural position the US occupies and the qualitatively different ways it can exercise power on a global scale.
C. Ignoring Moral and Racial Dimensions
A significant limitation of traditional realist analysis is its tendency to bracket or dismiss the role of morality, ideology, and particularly race in international politics. By focusing narrowly on states as rational, unitary actors pursuing material power and security in an anarchic system , realism often overlooks the crucial ways in which moral claims and racialized frameworks are used to justify imperial actions and structure global hierarchies.
Realist theory often treats the state's "national interest" as a given, without deeply interrogating how that interest is defined or how perceptions of threat and opportunity are formed. Critical scholarship, however, highlights the historical and ongoing centrality of race and racialization in shaping world politics. Far from being peripheral, racial dynamics were fundamental to the era of European imperialism, the justification of slavery, and even the major conflicts of the 20th century, including two World Wars fought among explicitly race-based empires led by individuals openly endorsing racist ideologies. The very concept of "the global" and the international order that emerged were built upon assumptions of racial hierarchy, which deemed certain peoples "naturally inferior" and thus available for exploitation or governance by others.
Despite the post-World War II normative shift against overt white supremacy, driven by decolonization and the Cold War context, racialized thinking continues to permeate international relations, often in more subtle forms. The concept of "racialization"—the process by which social phenomena are imbued with racial meaning and identities are constructed and imposed—is crucial here. Race is understood not as a biological reality but as a social construct, inherently involving assertions of power to categorize, essentialize, and rank human groups.
This process is directly relevant to understanding US foreign policy. The nation's settler-colonial origins were intrinsically tied to the racialization of Native Americans and Africans to legitimize dispossession and enslavement. These historical logics did not simply disappear; they were adapted and projected outward. As discussed previously, the ideology of "development," a cornerstone of US foreign policy for decades, can be understood as a racializing technology. It constructs hierarchies of nations and peoples based on perceived stages of progress, implicitly positioning the US (and the West more broadly) as the advanced model and justifying intervention—whether through aid, political pressure, or military force—as a mission to "uplift" or "modernize" those deemed less developed. This echoes the paternalistic and often explicitly racist justifications of earlier colonial eras.
Realism's focus on power calculations and state behavior struggles to incorporate these dimensions. It tends to view justifications as mere rhetoric or epiphenomena, rather than as potentially constitutive elements of policy itself. By ignoring how racialized ideologies shape perceptions (who is seen as a threat, who is deemed worthy of saving, whose sovereignty matters), define interests (the perceived need to manage or transform "backward" regions), and legitimize actions (framing intervention as benevolent uplift), realism provides an incomplete account of how and why US power is exercised.
A comprehensive understanding of US global power requires moving beyond the narrow confines of traditional realism. It necessitates analyzing not just the distribution of material capabilities but also the symbolic and ideological structures—often deeply racialized—that underpin and justify the exercise of that power. Race is not external to international power politics; it is frequently interwoven with its very fabric, shaping the identities, interests, and interactions that realism often takes for granted. Ignoring this dimension means missing a crucial element of how US empire is constructed, maintained, and legitimized, both domestically and internationally.
D. Tactic: Acknowledge and Transcend Realism
In critiquing the realist defense of US foreign policy, it is strategically useful to acknowledge the partial validity of the realist perspective before demonstrating its ultimate insufficiency. One can concede that the international system is indeed characterized by competition, insecurity, and the pursuit of power by states, including the United States. Realist concepts like the security dilemma, balance of power, and the importance of national interest offer valuable insights into certain aspects of state behavior.
However, having acknowledged these points, the analysis must then transcend the limitations of realism. The argument should pivot to demonstrate that while power politics is a reality, the specific manifestation of US power is unique and cannot be adequately explained by generic realist models alone. This involves highlighting the factors that realism typically overlooks or downplays:
 * Historical Specificity: Emphasize that the US is not an abstract "great power" but a state with a particular history rooted in settler colonialism, which instilled unique expansionist and racialized logics.
 * Unprecedented Scale: Underscore that the sheer scale of US global military and economic infrastructure creates a qualitative difference in its power and influence, moving beyond traditional balance-of-power dynamics.
 * Ideological & Racial Dimensions: Integrate the analysis of how ideological justifications (democracy promotion, development, humanitarianism) and underlying racialized assumptions shape US policy, legitimize interventions, and structure global hierarchies.
By acknowledging the realist baseline and then layering these additional dimensions of historical context, scale, and ideology/race, the critique becomes more nuanced and robust. It demonstrates that US imperial logic involves not just the pursuit of power, but a specific kind of power, exercised on an unparalleled scale, shaped by a unique historical trajectory, and justified through particular ideological frameworks. The goal is to show that understanding US global actions requires moving beyond realism to incorporate a richer, more critical analysis of both material and symbolic domination. The structure of US power, in this view, is historically constituted and ideologically maintained in ways that generic realism cannot fully capture.
III. The “Good Intentions” Apology
Their Claim: This line of defense concedes that US foreign policy actions may sometimes lead to negative or unintended consequences—citing examples like the instability following interventions in Iraq or Libya, or the mixed results of foreign aid programs. However, it maintains that the underlying intentions of the United States were fundamentally benevolent. The US, it is argued, meant well, aiming to provide aid, support rebuilding efforts, promote democracy, or act out of genuine humanitarian concern, even if the execution was flawed or the outcomes were regrettable.
Your Counter-Argument: The "good intentions" apology fails as a comprehensive defense of US foreign policy on two critical levels. First, empirically, the record often contradicts the claim of benevolent intent when examining the actual structure and effects of US "aid" and "rebuilding" efforts. These initiatives are frequently designed in ways that create economic dependency, empower local elites aligned with US interests, and sideline genuine grassroots development efforts. Second, and more fundamentally, the very notion of "good intentions" is problematic and requires critical scrutiny. Intentions do not arise in a vacuum; they emerge from specific worldviews and historical contexts. In the case of US foreign policy, these intentions are often demonstrably rooted in the same racialized, hierarchical, and settler-colonial logics of "uplift" and "civilizing missions" that historically served to legitimize imperial domination.
A. Development Aid Deepens Dependency
A primary pillar of the "good intentions" narrative rests on the provision of foreign aid, particularly development and economic assistance, presented as an altruistic effort to help other nations prosper. However, a closer look at the mechanisms and conditionalities attached to much of US foreign aid reveals a system often structured to serve US interests and integrate recipient economies into a global neoliberal order, sometimes hindering autonomous development and fostering dependency rather than self-sufficiency.
Multiple analyses assert that US foreign aid, despite humanitarian rhetoric, has consistently prioritized the maximization of US interests, whether geopolitical, economic, or ideological. It functions as a significant tool of "soft power" and, according to critics, "informal imperialism," shaping the political and economic landscape of recipient nations.
A key mechanism through which this influence is exerted is aid conditionality. US bilateral aid, as well as financing from IFIs like the IMF and World Bank (where the US holds significant sway), is frequently contingent upon the recipient country implementing specific economic policy reforms. These conditions often mandate adherence to neoliberal principles, such as privatization of state-owned enterprises, deregulation of markets, trade liberalization, and fiscal austerity. The explicit rationale is often to promote economic stability and create an environment conducive to growth. However, these externally imposed conditions severely limit the policy autonomy of recipient governments, preventing them from pursuing development strategies tailored to their specific national context or priorities. Compliance itself can be difficult, affected by external economic shocks or domestic political constraints, factors often beyond the recipient country's control.
The effectiveness of such conditionality in promoting sustainable development is highly contested. While proponents argue it enforces necessary discipline, critics contend that it often leads to policies that exacerbate inequality, undermine social safety nets, and prioritize integration into global markets over building robust domestic economies. The result can be a cycle of dependency, where nations remain reliant on external aid and subject to the policy prescriptions of donors and IFIs, without achieving genuine economic sovereignty. Despite shifts in donor rhetoric towards concepts like "partnership" and "ownership," studies suggest that conditionalities often remain numerous, detailed, and intrusive, reflecting donor priorities more than recipient needs. Ultimately, the provision of aid remains at the donors' discretion, giving them significant leverage.
The historical context of the Bretton Woods system is crucial here. The IMF and World Bank, key enforcers of contemporary conditionalities, were established under US leadership after World War II, embedding US economic ideology and power into the global financial architecture. Thus, the conditionalities attached to aid today are not neutral technical requirements but often reflect the enduring influence of a US-shaped global economic order.
This systematic use of conditionalities transforms foreign aid from a potentially straightforward act of support into a powerful mechanism of neoliberal discipline. Financial leverage is used to enforce adherence to a specific economic model favored by the United States and international capital. This structural reality fundamentally compromises the claim of purely "good intentions." Even if individual aid workers or policymakers hold benevolent motives, the system itself is structured in a way that prioritizes ideological conformity and integration into a US-led global economy, often at the expense of genuine partnership, local ownership, or the pursuit of diverse development pathways. The intention, as manifested in the structure of aid delivery, appears less about pure altruism and more about maintaining a hierarchical global order.
B. Interventions Empower Elites, Sideline Grassroots
Another facet of the "good intentions" defense involves portraying US interventions—whether through aid programs, democracy promotion, or even military action—as aimed at empowering local populations and supporting civil society. However, evidence suggests that these interventions often disproportionately benefit elite groups, co-opt potentially independent civil society organizations, and marginalize genuine grassroots movements that might pose a challenge to the existing power structures or US interests.
US "democracy promotion" efforts, for example, heavily rely on funding specific non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society groups within target countries. As discussed earlier, critics argue that institutions like NED channel these funds strategically to cultivate an elite-driven "polyarchy". This approach focuses on managing political transitions and ensuring stability rather than fostering broad-based, potentially disruptive, popular participation.
This pattern of elite capture and grassroots management is particularly evident in analyses of US influence in Latin America. During the era of neoliberal reforms in the 1980s and 1990s, ruling elites, often supported by the US and IFIs, actively promoted the growth of "grassroots" NGOs. These organizations, however, were typically heavily dependent on funding from external sources, including US and European governments and the World Bank. This financial dependency created a dynamic where NGOs acted as a "social cushion," addressing some of the social fallout from neoliberal policies (e.g., providing basic services that the state was retreating from) while simultaneously avoiding direct confrontation with the system that created those problems. They often adopted an "anti-statist" ideology that aligned with neoliberal critiques of the public sector, thereby inadvertently legitimizing state withdrawal from social responsibilities.
Furthermore, these externally funded NGOs often competed directly with autonomous social movements and trade unions for influence, resources, and personnel. By offering higher salaries, professional status, and access to resources, they could attract experienced activists and leaders away from more radical, independent organizations, thereby weakening the capacity of genuine grassroots movements. Their focus tended to be on localized, "self-help" projects and micro-enterprise development, which, while potentially beneficial at a small scale, often depoliticized poverty and inequality, diverting energy away from challenging national power structures and systemic issues. This approach fragmented communities into sectoral interests, hindering the development of broader solidarity and collective action against the root causes of their problems.
Agencies like USAID often work directly through this network of NGOs and civil society organizations, making them crucial partners in implementing Western foreign policy objectives. Due to the perception of NGOs as inherently benevolent actors, their role as potential instruments of foreign influence sometimes escapes critical scrutiny. Similar dynamics can be observed elsewhere. In the Middle East, neoliberal urban development often reinforces state control and benefits elites, while spaces for authentic grassroots participation and contestation remain limited or subject to co-optation. Historical analysis of US intervention in El Salvador also reveals complex dynamics where initial support for elite-aligned forces contributed to conditions that later necessitated grassroots organizing among the diaspora community created by the conflict.
This pattern suggests a discernible strategy within US foreign policy: engaging with and empowering specific, often elite-aligned or externally dependent, civil society actors while simultaneously managing, marginalizing, or co-opting potentially disruptive grassroots forces. Influencing civil society provides a less direct, yet potentially more effective, means of shaping political and social outcomes than overt control. By funding groups that focus on technical solutions, local projects, and collaboration within existing structures, the US can foster a managed "civil society" that absorbs social discontent and provides services, but poses little fundamental threat to dominant power structures or US strategic interests. This effectively sidelines movements advocating for more radical, systemic change from the bottom up. Therefore, the "good intention" of supporting civil society can mask a more sophisticated strategy of social control and political management, ensuring that any resulting change remains within acceptable, non-threatening boundaries.
C. “Intentions” Emerge from Racialized, Settler Logics
The most fundamental challenge to the "good intentions" apology lies in questioning the very source and nature of the intentions themselves. This defense assumes that intentions like "helping," "developing," or "uplifting" other nations are inherently neutral and benevolent. However, a critical historical perspective reveals that such intentions often emerge from deeply ingrained worldviews rooted in racialized hierarchies and the logics of settler colonialism—worldviews that position the United States (or the West, or whiteness more broadly) as inherently superior and possessing a unique right, or even duty, to intervene in and reshape other societies.
Settler colonialism, the foundational process of the United States, was predicated on the elimination and replacement of Indigenous populations. This project was explicitly justified through ideologies of racial superiority and civilizational hierarchy, which deemed Indigenous peoples as "savage" or "backward" and thus obstacles to progress that needed to be removed or assimilated. Similarly, the enslavement of Africans was rationalized through virulent anti-Black racism that denied their full humanity.
These logics of hierarchy and the perceived right of the "superior" group to dominate or manage the "inferior" extended into the broader ideology of the "civilizing mission" that characterized European colonialism globally. Colonial powers routinely framed their conquests and exploitative practices in the language of benevolent intention—claiming they were bringing progress, Christianity, and proper governance to supposedly benighted peoples.
Contemporary US foreign policy, particularly its emphasis on "development," arguably carries echoes of these historical logics. Scholars like Begüm Adalet argue that development ideology functions as a modern "racializing technology". It operates by constructing a hierarchy of nations and peoples based on perceived stages of economic and political progress, implicitly or explicitly placing Western models at the apex. This framework inherently racializes global populations, assigning different groups to different rungs on the developmental ladder. Consequently, interventions aimed at promoting development are often underpinned by the assumption that the target populations are deficient or lacking, requiring external guidance and transformation directed by the more "advanced" West. The "intention" to help is thus predicated on a diagnosis of inferiority or inadequacy in the other.
Racialization, as a process, infuses social phenomena with racial meaning, often based on assumptions about inherent group characteristics linked to descent, culture, or physical appearance. These processes were fundamental to historical imperialism and continue to shape contemporary international relations, influencing perceptions of threat, justifications for intervention, and the distribution of resources. When US policymakers express an "intention" to intervene for humanitarian reasons or to promote democracy, that intention is shaped by these historically sedimented, often unconscious, assumptions about who needs saving, who is capable of self-governance, and who possesses the right to intervene. Settler colonial studies further emphasize how these enduring structures of racialization and dispossession continue to shape present-day inequalities, for instance, in health outcomes for Indigenous populations.
Therefore, the "good intentions" invoked to defend US foreign policy cannot be accepted as inherently innocent or purely benevolent. They often spring from a worldview steeped in historical logics of racial hierarchy, civilizational stages, and settler-colonial assumptions about the right to manage land and people. An intention rooted in a belief in one's own superiority and the corresponding need to reshape or manage others is intrinsically problematic and carries the imprint of imperial thinking, regardless of how positively it is framed. The negative outcomes of interventions, from this perspective, are not simply unfortunate "mistakes" but can be seen as predictable consequences of actions based on flawed, hierarchical, and potentially racialized premises.
D. Key Argument Synthesis: The Imperialism of Intent
In conclusion, the "good intentions" apology fails because intentions are inseparable from the worldviews that generate them. When the underlying worldview is shaped by historical legacies of racial hierarchy, civilizational rankings, and settler-colonial assumptions about managing land and populations, the resulting "good intentions" often serve primarily to legitimize interventions that replicate patterns of domination and control. The empirical evidence showing aid structures that foster dependency and interventions that empower elites while marginalizing grassroots movements further contradicts the notion of purely benevolent motives. Poor outcomes, therefore, should not be dismissed as mere accidents or failures of execution; they can often be understood as the logical consequences of actions rooted in problematic, hierarchical premises. Critiquing US foreign policy requires moving beyond accepting stated intentions at face value and instead examining the historical, ideological, and structural contexts from which these intentions emerge. An intention to "help" that is predicated on an assumption of the other's inherent deficiency is, itself, a reflection of an imperial mindset.
IV. The “Whataboutism” Deflection
Their Claim: Critics of US foreign policy are often met with a deflecting counter-question: "What about...?" This defense points to the actions of other powerful states—typically China, Russia, or historical empires like Great Britain—to argue that US behavior is not uniquely egregious. The implication is that criticizing the US is hypocritical or unfair given the transgressions of others, and that the US, by comparison, is no worse, and perhaps even better, than the available alternatives.
Your Counter-Argument: This "whataboutism" defense is a well-recognized logical fallacy (tu quoque, or the appeal to hypocrisy) employed primarily as a rhetorical tactic to deflect scrutiny and derail substantive critique. While other states undoubtedly engage in oppressive, expansionist, or unethical behavior, these actions are logically irrelevant to the assessment of US foreign policy on its own terms. Comparing atrocities or imperial ambitions does not negate the specific structures, scale, and impacts of US global power. Furthermore, the unique role of the United States in constructing and dominating the current international system makes its actions particularly consequential and worthy of specific analysis, distinct from the actions of its challengers or predecessors.
A. Comparative Brutality Does Not Negate Structural Imperialism
The core flaw in the whataboutism defense is its logical irrelevance. Pointing to the wrongdoing of Party B does nothing to absolve Party A of responsibility for its own actions. Whether or not China represses ethnic minorities, Russia invades its neighbors, or Britain engaged in brutal colonial practices has no bearing on the separate question of whether the United States itself operates as an empire based on its own distinct history, structures, and actions. The existence of other wrongs does not diminish or excuse a specific wrong under examination.
Whataboutism is formally defined as a rhetorical strategy that responds to an accusation or critique not by addressing the substance of the claim, but by making a counter-accusation against the accuser or a third party. Its primary functions are often distraction (a red herring), discrediting the critic by alleging hypocrisy or double standards, and shifting the focus away from the original issue. While comparisons can occasionally be used legitimately to provide context or expose genuine double standards , the typical use of whataboutism in defending US foreign policy serves to shut down critical discussion rather than enrich it.
The analysis of US imperialism presented here focuses on specific, identifiable features: its roots in settler colonialism , its establishment of an unprecedented global network of military bases and economic influence , its promotion of neoliberal economic models through conditional aid and IFIs , its use of political tools like NED to manage dissent , and the underpinning role of racialized ideologies. These structures and practices exist and have tangible effects on global politics, economics, and societies, entirely independent of the actions undertaken by Beijing or Moscow.
Critiquing US empire does not necessitate asserting that the US is uniquely evil, nor does it require portraying other powers as benevolent. It involves a specific analysis of the nature, mechanisms, and consequences of US power within the global system it has largely shaped and continues to dominate. The whataboutism defense fundamentally seeks to evade this structural analysis by changing the subject and demanding a comparative moral calculus as a precondition for critique. Recognizing this tactic is essential to maintain analytical focus on the subject at hand—the structure of US power—and resist attempts to obfuscate the issue through irrelevant comparisons.
B. US Global Presence and Reach Exceeds Rivals
While the whataboutism defense often implies a rough equivalence between the actions or ambitions of the US and its main geopolitical rivals, particularly China and Russia, this comparison overlooks the profound asymmetries in the scale, scope, and nature of their respective global power infrastructures. The United States possesses a unique and unparalleled global presence that distinguishes it significantly from any other contemporary power.
As detailed previously, the US maintains a vast network of approximately 750-800 military base sites across roughly 80 countries, constituting the vast majority of the world's foreign military installations. This military reach is orders of magnitude greater than that of Russia (estimated 12-36 bases) or China (estimated 8 bases). This extensive basing network, combined with superior military technology and logistical capabilities, grants the US a capacity for global power projection that no other state can currently match.
This military dominance is complemented by enduring economic supremacy. Despite challenges, the US dollar remains the world's primary reserve currency, and the US continues to wield significant influence within the key international financial institutions (IMF, World Bank) that govern global finance—institutions largely established under its post-WWII leadership. US corporations, financial markets, and technological innovation continue to exert immense global influence.
Furthermore, the US projects significant ideological power through its cultural exports (media, entertainment, technology), its globally attractive higher education system, and its active promotion of specific political and economic models (liberal democracy and neoliberal capitalism), even if applied selectively. This integrated structure of military, economic, and ideological power (the IEMP model) creates a mutually reinforcing system of global influence that is historically unprecedented.
While China is undoubtedly a rising power with significant economic reach (e.g., the Belt and Road Initiative) and growing military capabilities (e.g., in the South China Sea) , and Russia actively challenges US influence in its perceived sphere and beyond , neither currently possesses the comprehensive, integrated, and geographically dispersed network of bases, alliances, institutional control, and soft power projection that characterizes US hegemony. The US system is more deeply entrenched, more multidimensional, and more truly global in its reach.
Therefore, direct comparisons inherent in the whataboutism defense are often misleading because they flatten these crucial asymmetries. They ignore the fundamental difference in the structural position occupied by the US versus its rivals. The US is not simply one great power among several equals; it remains the principal architect and dominant power within the existing global order. Its actions, therefore, have systemic implications that differ qualitatively from those of states challenging that order or operating primarily within regional spheres of influence. Acknowledging the actions of China and Russia is necessary for a complete picture of global politics, but understanding the unique structural dominance of the US is paramount for accurately analyzing contemporary power dynamics.
C. US Built the Postwar System Rivals Now Exploit/Challenge
A further critical distinction ignored by the whataboutism defense relates to the historical construction of the current international order. The system that China and Russia are often accused of challenging or undermining is, in large part, a system designed and implemented by the United States in the aftermath of World War II to serve its own interests and consolidate its global leadership. Rivals operate within, react against, or seek to modify a framework fundamentally shaped by US hegemony.
The Bretton Woods conference in 1944 laid the foundations for the post-war international economic order, establishing the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank under significant US influence. This system institutionalized the centrality of the US dollar, pegged to gold, creating a stable environment for international trade and finance that facilitated US economic expansion and political influence. While the original fixed exchange rate system collapsed in the early 1970s , the core institutions (IMF, World Bank) and the dollar's dominant role persisted, continuing to structure the global economy according to principles largely aligned with US interests. This post-war order, often referred to as the "rules-based international order," reflected American values and provided the US with considerable structural power.
For decades, US policy encouraged the integration of countries like Russia and China into this system, operating under the assumption that participation in global markets and institutions would lead to their political and economic liberalization and alignment with the US-led order. China's dramatic economic rise, for instance, was significantly enabled by its integration into the global trading system, culminating in its entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO). Russia, too, sought integration, joining bodies like the G7 (temporarily) and the WTO.
The current era is now characterized by the perception that these same powers have become "strategic competitors" who are challenging the very order they joined. China pursues alternative economic pathways like the Belt and Road Initiative, seeks greater influence in international finance, and asserts regional military power. Russia actively challenges US influence in Eastern Europe and globally, seeking to reassert its status as a major power.
However, it is crucial to recognize that these challenges are largely occurring within or in reaction to the existing US-shaped global structure. China seeks to modify the rules of the game or build parallel institutions, leveraging the globalized system for its own benefit. Russia often acts as a disruptor, seeking to undermine US influence and carve out its own sphere. They are contesting the hegemon, but largely on the terrain constructed by that hegemon.
This historical context reveals a dynamic not simply of competing imperialisms, but of hegemonic construction followed by hegemonic contestation. The US established the dominant framework; rivals now navigate, exploit, or push back against that framework. Attributing equivalent "imperial" motives or actions ignores this fundamental difference in structural position and historical role. The US acts primarily to maintain and manage a global order it built, while challengers act to alter, resist, or find advantage within that order. This distinction is vital for analyzing their respective behaviors and impacts accurately. Whataboutism obscures this crucial historical and structural context.
D. Conclusion Synthesis: Resisting Deflection
The "Whataboutism" defense, ultimately, is a rhetorical maneuver designed to evade substantive critique of US power. By shifting focus to the actions of other states, it deliberately ignores the unique structural position, historical trajectory, and unparalleled scale of US global influence. While the actions of China, Russia, and other powers are significant and warrant analysis in their own right, they do not invalidate or render irrelevant the specific critique of US imperialism. A rigorous analysis must resist this deflection and maintain focus on the mechanisms, justifications, and consequences of US actions within the global system it continues to dominate. The objective is not a simplistic ranking of nations from "best" to "worst," but a clear-eyed understanding of the dominant structural force shaping contemporary global politics – the enduring, multifaceted empire of influence wielded by the United States.
Conclusion
The examination of these four common defenses reveals their inadequacy in shielding US foreign policy from the critique of empire. Arguments appealing to liberal internationalist ideals falter against the evidence of selective application and the instrumentalization of norms for geopolitical gain. Realist claims of pragmatic, standard great power behavior fail to account for the unique settler-colonial origins and unprecedented global scale of US power, while neglecting the crucial role of racialized ideologies in justifying its actions. The apology based on "good intentions" dissolves when confronted with aid structures designed for dependency, interventions that empower elites, and the problematic, historically-rooted assumptions often underlying the very notion of benevolent intervention. Finally, the "whataboutism" deflection serves merely as a logical fallacy to evade scrutiny, ignoring the specific structures of US power and its unique role in shaping the current global order.
Taken together, the refutations presented in this appendix point towards a consistent and coherent understanding of the United States' role in the world. The evidence indicates a persistent, structural form of global power that functions imperially, even if it eschews widespread direct territorial control. This structure is characterized by:
 * An unparalleled global infrastructure integrating military presence, economic leverage, and ideological projection.
 * The systematic promotion of neoliberal economic models that often prioritize market access and capital accumulation over genuine national sovereignty and equitable development.
 * The strategic and selective deployment of democracy and human rights rhetoric, often serving as ideological cover for actions driven by other interests.
 * A pattern of intervention—through aid, political influence, covert operations, or military force—that frequently reinforces existing elite power structures and manages or marginalizes grassroots challenges to the status quo.
 * An underlying ideological framework informed by historical legacies of settler-colonial expansionism, racial hierarchy, and civilizational assumptions that justify intervention and management.
Unmasking the structure of US empire, as undertaken here, is not an exercise in assigning unique moral condemnation. Rather, it is an effort to achieve analytical clarity. Recognizing the recurring patterns of influence, intervention, justification, and consequence allows for a more accurate and critical understanding of contemporary global power dynamics. It illuminates the profound challenges faced by nations and peoples seeking genuine sovereignty, substantive democracy, and equitable development within an international system still deeply shaped by the enduring legacy and ongoing practices of American hegemony. This critical perspective is not merely an academic exercise; it is an essential prerequisite for imagining and working towards alternative global futures based on principles of equality, justice, and mutual respect.
